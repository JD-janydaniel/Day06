<h3>Class - Movie</h3>
<h4>The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>title, which is a String representing the title of the movie</li>
  <li>studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie</li>
  <li>rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.</li>
  <li>The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.</li>
  <li>Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.</li>
  <li>Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”</li>
